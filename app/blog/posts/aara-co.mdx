# overview and objectives

For this project, my aim was to develop a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of handling uniform orders for schools. The envisioned system included essential features such as dynamic invoice generation, inventory management, and distinct applications for both clients and administrators.

The Objectives of the Application are the following:

- To create a user interface that is resembling an e-commerce website and is easy to navigate and understand

- To use a combination of Client and Server Side Rendering to display the products available to the user

- Cache the Products fetched in case the user wishes to place another order

- Implement a function that keeps the user logged in by using phone number as a means to log in. The user must be able to successfully log in even after a month and must be able to view the orders they have placed.

- To display information such as Product Title, Price, and Placeholder Image that a parent can buy dynamically based on the grade the student is being promoted to and gender

- To Enable an Add to Cart Feature and also show all financial-related information, such as subtotal, CGST, and SGST, and grand total in the cart itself, aiding in total transparency before order placement.

- Upon placing the order on the client side, the data must be stored in a separate table called clientOrders having the ‘parent’s mobile number + child’s name’ as the Primary Key
  Eg: +911234567890-Dhanush

- Have the option for the parent to edit the order they placed before proceeding to the billing desk to confirm.

- On the Admin Application, have an input bar that will search the clientOrders table and return the items placed by the end user and also enable a button that will confirm this order and push this to another table called, confirmedOrders

- Upon confirming, enable another button to download the invoice whose invoice number is generated by counting the number of entries in the confirmedOrders table and incrementing it by 1.

- Upon Confirmation, also enable a button on the client side that allows the parent to download the invoice along with the Invoice Number in case the physical copy is misplaced.

- Generate Statistics and Reports by producing charts and graphs on the quantity, size, and id of the items placed.

# process

- The development of this project commenced in January 2023 and continued until March 2023. However, ongoing improvements, minor fixes, and additional features were consistently implemented, extending the development phase until June 2023.

- Similar to the previous project, this endeavor has undergone several iterations, each representing a distinct version. Let's embark on a journey through its evolution, starting from the initial version and progressing towards the current state.

- Before delving into the project's evolution, let's establish its fundamental goals and the problems it aimed to address.

- In the context of ordering uniforms in schools, a significant challenge was the considerable time spent in queues to place orders, make payments, and obtain invoices. The primary objective of this project was to devise an intuitive solution to minimize the time spent waiting in line, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the uniform ordering process.

- It's important to emphasize that each version of this project encompasses two distinct sides: the client side and the admin side.

- The client side represents the perspective of the parent placing the uniform order, while the admin side corresponds to the person at the billing desk responsible for order confirmation and invoice generation.

# implementation - version 1

- In this particular version of the project, a Complex Google Form was employed for the client side, while the admin side utilized a React Application.

- The client's process involved completing the form by selecting items, specifying quantities and sizes, and submitting the details, which were then stored in a Google Sheet.

- To establish connectivity between the Google Sheet and the React Application, we used the Google Sheet API provided by Google Cloud. This integration facilitated the data transfer between the client and admin sides of the application.

- Upon the client's form submission, at the billing desk, the admin would inquire about the client's phone number to retrieve the relevant data from the connected Google Sheet.

- In the event of multiple form submissions by a single client, the React Application featured a table where each row represented a record associated with that phone number.

- The admin, in collaboration with the client, would identify the specific order to be completed and confirmed. A straightforward radio button system was implemented alongside each record, allowing for easy selection and display of the chosen order's details on the screen. Upon successful payment, the application utilized jsPDF, a package capable of converting a DOM element into a PDF. The generated PDF, representing the order and invoice, was then added to a collection named "Confirmed Orders" in the Real-Time Database.

- Addressing the crucial concept of invoice generation, adhering to government regulations necessitated maintaining a sequential order for invoices. Given the scenario where multiple admins were serving clients simultaneously, ensuring concurrent and consistent data across devices became a priority. To tackle this challenge, we devised an intuitive algorithm.

- Before initiating the invoice generation process, we implemented a query to the "Confirmed Orders" collection, counting the number of records within it. By adding 1 to the invoice number of the last record, we generated the invoice number for the current order. This approach guaranteed sequential and synchronized invoicing, meeting regulatory requirements while accommodating multiple admins interacting with the system concurrently.

- A significant drawback of this approach surfaced during the process of calculating the total of selected items and rendering them on the screen. The implementation relied on complex conditional rendering, resulting in the component responsible for rendering the table expanding to over 1000 lines. This intricate structure made the component challenging to extend and modify, highlighting the need for a more scalable and maintainable solution in subsequent iterations.

```js
{
  (formData[0][index].includes("Winter Jacket") &&
    formData[0][index].includes("F14")) ||
  (formData[0][index].includes("Winter Jacket") &&
    formData[0][index].includes("M14")) ||
  (formData[0][index].includes("Winter Jacket") &&
    formData[0][index].includes("O14")) ? (
    <>
      <span className="useless">
        {finalItems.push({
          name: formData[0][index],
          qty: elements[index + 1],
          size: item,
        })}
      </span>
      <td key={index} className="textcenter">
        {prices.HoodieS14}
      </td>
      <td key={index} className="textright">
        {elements[index + 1] * prices.HoodieS14}
      </td>
      <p className="useless">
        {" "}
        {(gst5Total += 0.05 * elements[index + 1] * prices.HoodieS14)}
      </p>
      <p className="useless">
        {(subtotal += elements[index + 1] * prices.HoodieS14)}
      </p>
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      {formData[0][index].includes("Winter Jacket") &&
      formData[0][index].includes("S512") ? (
        <>
          <span className="useless">
            {finalItems.push({
              name: formData[0][index],
              qty: elements[index + 1],
              size: item,
            })}
          </span>
          <td key={index} className="textcenter">
            {prices.HoodieS512}
          </td>
          <td key={index} className="textright">
            {elements[index + 1] * prices.HoodieS512}
          </td>
          <p className="useless">
            {(gst5Total += 0.05 * elements[index + 1] * prices.HoodieS512)}
          </p>
          <p className="useless">
            {(subtotal += elements[index + 1] * prices.HoodieS512)}
          </p>
        </>
      ) : (
        ""
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

# implementation - version 2

- In this version, two NextJS applications were employed – one for the client and one for the admin. The technology stack for these applications has been detailed above.

- Let's delve into the client application first, understand its flow, and subsequently explore the admin side.

- The client application adopted a user interface reminiscent of an e-commerce platform with a few tailored adjustments. Upon visiting the URL, users were prompted to verify their phone number by entering an OTP, facilitated by Firebase Auth. Returning users could conveniently log in with their mobile number.

- The Front End comprises of 3 Tabs, the Profile Tab, the Main Screen and the Cart.

- For first-time users, a visit to the profile tab was necessary. Here, they were prompted to input information about the children for whom they intended to place orders.

- Within the profile tab, we introduced a crucial component named "Previous Orders." Recognizing the common tendency to misplace invoices, this feature aimed to provide a convenient solution. The component facilitated the querying of any orders previously made by the logged-in user. Additionally, a download button was incorporated, allowing users to retrieve the invoice for a specific past order with ease. This thoughtful addition enhanced user convenience and accessibility to historical order information.

- Crucial details such as the student's name, gender, and the upcoming academic year's grade were collected during this onboarding process.

- We used Firebase Functions along with Firestore to automatically create a User record for the client as soon as they logged in, and information collected about the children would be stored in the same document as an additional snippet.

- After adding student information, a Select Tag would dynamically appear on the Main Screen, prompting the user to choose which student they intended to place orders for. The items presented on the screen were determined by a combination of two factors: the gender of the child and the grade they would be entering.

- Users could then interact with the displayed items, tapping on any product of interest. This action would trigger a modal, providing detailed information about the selected item.

- Within the modal, users had the flexibility to specify the size and quantity before adding the item to their cart. This intuitive process streamlined the user experience and facilitated efficient order placement for the selected student.

- The Cart tab showed the user the items they selected, along with all the financial information such as Sub Total, CGST, SGST and Final Total.

- Orders placed on the client side would be stored in a Firestore Collection called “Client Orders”

- Transitioning to the admin application, it boasted several essential features. The "Statistics" section offered administrators graphical representations and tallies, providing insights into the manufacturing requirements. This encompassed details like the quantity of items for each size to be produced and comprehensive summaries of overall order details, including the total items slated for manufacturing.

- Furthermore, the admin application facilitated robust inventory management capabilities. Admins could seamlessly add new items, specify their prices, input available sizes, and designate the applicable gender and grade for each item. This extended to the ability to edit existing items and efficiently remove those that were no longer relevant. This comprehensive suite of features empowered administrators with effective control over the inventory and production aspects of the uniform ordering system.

- The Main screen of the Admin Application was composed of three key components: a Left Search Bar, the Main Screen, and a Right Search Bar. Similar to the initial version, the admin would request the user's phone number, enter it into the left search bar, which in turn would query the "Client Orders" table. The result would be a set of cards displaying orders associated with the provided mobile number.

- Upon selecting a card, the Main screen would dynamically populate with the detailed information of the selected order. As in the previous version, buttons were available to confirm orders and generate invoices. Once confirmed, these orders would be stored in a distinct collection labeled "Confirmed Orders."

- In the event that an order was confirmed but the invoice was not generated, admins could utilize the right tab. By entering the phone number, this tab would query the "Confirmed Orders" collection, enabling admins to generate an invoice from the stored data.

- A noteworthy feature of the admin application was the ability for administrators to initiate the invoicing process from a specific invoice number. While the conventional approach involved finding the last item in the confirmed orders table and incrementing its invoice number, this application offered flexibility. In instances where the admin desired to commence invoicing from a different number, the application facilitated this adjustment, providing a customizable solution to meet varying invoicing requirements.

```js
<Table variant="simple">
  <Thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th color="white">Image</Th>
      <Th color="white">Item</Th>
      <Th color="white">Size</Th>
      <Th color="white" isNumeric>
        Quantity
      </Th>
      <Th color="white" isNumeric>
        Rate
      </Th>
      <Th color="white" isNumeric>
        Amount
      </Th>
    </Tr>
  </Thead>
  <Tbody>
    {orderToConfirm.order.cartItems.map((item, index) => (
      <Tr key={index}>
        <Td>
          <Image src={item.imageURL} width="30px" alt={item.title} />
        </Td>
        <Td>{item.title}</Td>
        <Td>{item.size}</Td>
        <Td isNumeric>{item.quantity}</Td>
        <Td isNumeric>{item.price}</Td>
        <Td isNumeric>{item.price * item.quantity}</Td>
      </Tr>
    ))}
  </Tbody>
</Table>
```
